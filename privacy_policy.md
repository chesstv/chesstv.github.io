Google Analytics
================

We use Google Analytics to collect anonymous data, which helps us to improve our app and our website.

We do *NOT* collect any personal information.

So what does Google Analytics record?

* The website you came from
* How long you stay on this website
* What kind of computer you're using
* And more

But how does this information help us, and how can we use it? 

It helps us learn where we need to focus our efforts to please you, our customer. Without getting too business-y, it helps us make better decisions. Some examples include

* Releasing multiple language versions.
* Improving the website experience for the most widely used devices.
* Learning more about you and our other customers by seeing which websites they came from.

This would all be guesswork without any kind of tracking. Remember, we don't know who you are, and never will. The data collected by Google Analytics is not in any way connected to any personal information, that you may or may not enter.

All of my activities fall within the bounds of the [Google Analytics Terms Of Service](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html)


Google Analytics Advertising
============================

We have implemented the following Google Analytics Advertising features:

* Display and Search Remarketing
* Advertising Reporting Features

Why do we need any of this?

The data collected here (again, totally anonymous) helps us identify which keywords are most relevant to our customers, among other things. If this is your kind of app, we want to make sure you can find us, and we want to make sure other people can too.

If you'd like to "opt-out" from this data being collected, there are a number of different ways to do so. You can change your Ads Settings inside your Google Account, Ads Settings for Mobile apps, and there exist options such as NAI's consumer opt out, which you can read more about [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). Additionally, there is [a tool offered by Google](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/?hl=en) to turn off, or opt out, of Google Analytics by using a Browser Plugin.
